Functional JSON for F#. This is a fairly early work in progress (not ready for sensible use yet). It provides a core functional JSON AST, a set of Aether lenses over the AST, a basic monad over a JSON type, a parser (currently lightly tweaked from the FParsec tutorial) a serializer (currently unpleasantly written and in need of a good clean) and a mapping system based on the excellent work that Mauricio Scheffer has done with Fleece.

It's still in flux with regards to APIs and currently has release status "unreleased: curio". Soon though!
